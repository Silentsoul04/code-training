As a flashcard user, I’d like to be able to go through one flashcard at a time, so I can memorize the definitions and terms.

As a flashcard user, I’d like to be able to try three times to guess the definition, then be shown it if I fail the third guess, so that I can try different options and learn the answer eventually.
As a flashcard user, I’d like to be able to quit the program at any time, so I can use the flashcards however long that I’d like to.
