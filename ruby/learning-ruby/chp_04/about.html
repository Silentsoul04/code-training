<h1>About this chapter</h1>

<p>You just learned how to create your own data structures.  In this
chapter we go to the next step.  We will turn these structures into
our very own classes, <b>Address</b>, <b>Person</b> and 
<b>Addressbook</b>, with their own methods.</p>

<p>These will be full-fleged classes, on par with <b>Integer</b>, 
<b>String</b>, <b>Array</b> and <b>Hash</b>.</p>

<p>Creating your own classes has many powerful advantages:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Code reuse</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>Remember how many lines it took to print the addressbook?
  Wouldn't it be nice if we could write that just once, and then
  type "<b>puts addressbook</b>" every time we want to print it?</p>

  <p>In this chapter we are going to do just that.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Data abstraction</dt>
  <dd>
  <p>This is geek-speak which essentially means you can write the
  class and the forget about the "details" of how you did it.
  Do you know how the class <b>String</b> was made?  No, but you still
  know how to use it.</p>
