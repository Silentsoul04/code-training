<h1>Classes and methods</h1>

<p>Now we are ready to create our very own <b>Address</b> class.
Let's start simple.  Let's start with an address that only
contains the "street" field.</p>

<p>This is how you define a class:</p>

                   <!-- Pick a small width so the table has to
                        expand and just fits the required size. -->
                   <table class="code" width="10%">
                   <tr>
                   <td>
                   <pre class="code">

class Address
    def initialize(street)  
        @street = street 
    end
end
                       </pre>

                       </td>
                       </tr>
                       </table>

<p>Let's go through this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The <b>class</b> keyword defines a class.</p></li>
<li><p>By defining a method inside this class, we are associating it 
    with this class.</p></li>
<li><p>The <b>initialize</b> method is what actually constructs
    the data structure.  Every class <strong>must</strong>
    contain an <b>initialize</b> method.</p></li>
<li><p><b>@street</b> is an object variable.  Similar to the keys
    of a hash.
    The <b>@</b> sign distinguishes <b>@street</b>
    as an object variable. Every time you create an object of the 
    class <b>Address</b>, this object will contain a <b>@street</b>
    variable.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Let's use this class to create an address object.</p>

                   <!-- Pick a small width so the table has to
                        expand and just fits the required size. -->
                   <table class="code" width="10%">
                   <tr>
                   <td>
                   <pre class="code">

address = Addres.new("23 St George St.")  
                       </pre>

                       </td>
                       </tr>
                       </table>

<p>That's it.  <b>address</b> is now an object of the class
<b>Address</b></p>

<h2>Reading the data in an object</h2>

<p>Suppose that we want to read the data in the <b>address</b> object.
To do this, we need to write a method that returns this data:</p>

                   <!-- Pick a small width so the table has to
                        expand and just fits the required size. -->
                   <table class="code" width="10%">
                   <tr>
                   <td>
                   <pre class="code">

class Address
    def initialize(street)   
        @street = street 
    end

    # Just return @street
    def street
        @street
    end
end
                       </pre>

                       </td>
                       </tr>
                       </table>

<p>Now the method <b>Address#street</b> lets you read the street
of the address.  In <b>irb</b>:</p>

                   <!-- Pick a small width so the table has to
                        expand and just fits the required size. -->
                   <table class="code" width="10%">
                   <tr>
                   <td>
                   <pre class="code">

>> address.street 
=> "23 St George St."
                       </pre>

                       </td>
                       </tr>
                       </table>

<p>A property of an object, which is visible outside, is called
an <em>attribute</em>.  In this case, <b>street</b> is is an attribute.
In particular, it is a <em>readable attribute</em>.  Because this kind
of attribute is very common, Ruby offers you a shortcut through the 
<b>attr_reader</b> keyword:</p>


                   <!-- Pick a small width so the table has to
                        expand and just fits the required size. -->
                   <table class="code" width="10%">
                   <tr>
                   <td>
                   <pre class="code">

class Address
    attr_reader :self
    def initialize(street)   
        @street = street 
    end
end
                       </pre>

                       </td>
                       </tr>
                       </table>

<h2>Changing the data in an object</h2>

<p>We can also define a method to change the data in an object.</p>

                   <!-- Pick a small width so the table has to
                        expand and just fits the required size. -->
                   <table class="code" width="10%">
                   <tr>
                   <td>
                   <pre class="code">

class Address
    attr_reader :street
    def initialize(street)  
        @street = street 
    end
    def street=(street)
        @street = street
    end
end
                       </pre>

                       </td>
                       </tr>
                       </table>

<p>Ruby is pretty smart in its use of the <b>street=</b> method:</p>

                   <!-- Pick a small width so the table has to
                        expand and just fits the required size. -->
                   <table class="code" width="10%">
                   <tr>
                   <td>
                   <pre class="code">

address.street = "45 Main St."
                       </pre>

                       </td>
                       </tr>
                       </table>

<p>Notice that you can put spaces betten <b>street</b> and <b>=</b>.
Now that we can change the address data, we can simplify the
<b>initialize</b> method, and have it simply default the
street to the empty string "".</p>

                   <!-- Pick a small width so the table has to
                        expand and just fits the required size. -->
                   <table class="code" width="10%">
                   <tr>
                   <td>
                   <pre class="code">

class Address
    attr_reader :street
    def initialize
        @street = ""
    end
    def street=(street)
        @street = street  
    end
end

address = Address.new
address.street = "23 St George St."  
                       </pre>

                       </td>
                       </tr>
                       </table>

<p>This might not seem like much of a simplification, but when we
add the city, state and zip fields, and more methods this will
make the class definition a bit simpler.</p>

<p>Now, <b>street</b> is also a <em>writable attribute</em>.  As before, 
you can declare it as such with <b>attr_writer</b>:</p>

                   <!-- Pick a small width so the table has to
                        expand and just fits the required size. -->
                   <table class="code" width="10%">
                   <tr>
                   <td>
                   <pre class="code">

class Address
    attr_reader :street
    attr_writer :street  
    def initialize
        @street = ""
    end
end
                       </pre>

                       </td>
                       </tr>
                       </table>

<h2>Accessing data</h2>

<p>Very often, you have attributes that are both readable and writable
attributes.  Ruby lets you lump these together with <b>attr_accessor</b>.
I guess these would be called "accessible attributes", but I have never
seen them be called that.</p>

                   <!-- Pick a small width so the table has to
                        expand and just fits the required size. -->
                   <table class="code" width="10%">
                   <tr>
                   <td>
                   <pre class="code">

class Address
    attr_accessor :street  
    def initialize
        @street = ""
    end
end
                       </pre>

                       </td>
                       </tr>
                       </table>

<p>With this knowledge, it is now easy to define the entire
addressbook structure.  As it turns out, <b>attr_accessor</b> and
friends all accept multiple arguments.</p>

                   <!-- Pick a small width so the table has to
                        expand and just fits the required size. -->
                   <table class="code" width="10%">
                   <tr>
                   <td>
                   <pre class="code">

class Address
    attr_accessor :street, :city, :state, :zip  
    def initialize
        @street = @city = @state = @zip = ""
    end
end
                       </pre>
                       </td>
                       </tr>
                       </table>
