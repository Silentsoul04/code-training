<h1>Writing good programs</h1>

<p>Proper use of functions, methods and classes is one of the
distinguishing marks of an experienced programmer.  Here are some
important pieces of advice.</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Functions and methods -- small is beautiful.</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>A function or a method should do <em>one</em> thing and do it 
    well</em>.</p>
    <ul>
       <li><p>If you can't sumarize in one sentence what the function
       does, it's probably too complicated.</p></li>
       <li><p>If you have to scroll to see the entire function, it is
       too long.</p></li>
       <li><p>Studies suggest that a person can only keep track of at
       most 7 or so things at one time.  If your function has more 
       than 5 or 6 variables, it is probably too long.</p></li>
    </ul>
    </dd>

    <dt>Comments</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>As you write more complex programs, the use of comments becomes
    more important.</p>
    <ul>
       <li><p>Comments don't have to be long.  They just have to
       explain the purpose of the code clearly.</p></li>

       <li><p>Every function should have a comment that states what
       the function does.  The exception is a function that is so simple
       that it's use is obvious.  For example:</p>
         <ul>
           <li><p>The methods <b>initialize</b>, <b>add</b> and 
               <b>remove</b> didn't need comments.</p></li>
           <li><p>In <b>AddresBook</b>, the methods <b>each</b> and
               <b>each_address</b> have only a one simple
               comment.  The comment says that they are iterators.
               Once the developer knows that they are iterators, their
               use becomes apparent from their names.</p></li>
           <li><p>The method <b>by_name</b> has a comment saying that
               it is a sorting function.  Once you know that, it's use
               is also apparent.</p></li>
         </ul>
         </li>

       <li><p>Comments can also be used to group together related
       functions.  For instance, in <b>AddressBook</b> I used comments
       to group together "fundamental functions", "iterators" and
       "sorting functions".</p>
       <p>Always try to divide your code into manageable pieces.</p>
          </li>
    </ul> 
    </dd>
