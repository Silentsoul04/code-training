<h1>More features</h1>

<p>There are just a couple more things that we should do with our
<b>AddressBook</b> class.</p>

<h2>Private and public methods</h2>

<p>Take a look at <b>AddressBook#by_name</b>.  This method is different
from the other methods in one important respect: It is used only 
<em>inside</em> the object.  It is an internal method.</p>

<p>When you have a method like this, it is best to declare it as <b>
private</b>.  A <strong>private</strong> method can only be accessed by 
the object itself, and never by the user.  A regular method, that 
is available to the user, is called <strong>public</strong>.</p>

<p>You can declare methods as public and private with the (surprise!)
<b>public</b> and <b>private</b> keywords.  When you put the
keyword <b>private</b> you set all the methods defined from then on
as private, until you change it back wit the <b>public</b> keyword.</p>

                   <!-- Pick a small width so the table has to
                        expand and just fits the required size. -->
                   <table class="code" width="10%">
                   <tr>
                   <td>
                   <pre class="code">

class SomeClass

    def method1 # default to public
        ...
    end

  private   # subsequent methods are private.  

    def method2 # private method
        ...
    end
    def method3 # private method
        ...
    end

  public    # Set back to public.

    def method4 # public method
        ...
    end
end
                       </pre>

                       </td>
                       </tr>
                       </table>

<p>So, in our case, we just want to put the <b>private</b> keyword
before we define the <b>by_name</b> method.</p>

                   <!-- Pick a small width so the table has to
                        expand and just fits the required size. -->
                   <table class="code" width="10%">
                   <tr>
                   <td>
                   <pre class="code">

class AddressBook
    #
    #  Fundamental methods: initialize, add, remove
    #
    def initialize
        @persons = []
    end
    def add(person)
        @persons += [person]
        @persons = @persons.sort{|a,b| by_name(a,b)}  
    end

    ...

  private  # Start private methods
        
    #  
    #  Sorting function.
    #
    def by_name(a,b)
        if  a.first_name  == b.first_name
            a.last_name  <=> b.last_name
        else
            a.first_name <=> b.first_name
        end 
    end
end
                       </pre>

                       </td>
                       </tr>
                       </table>


<h2>Code reuse with <b>require</b></h2>

<p>We have spent a lot of time writing these three classes.  We don't 
want to copy and paste the code every time we want to use them in a
program.  Fortunatelly, we don't have to.</p>

<p>Put all three classes in a file, and save it as <b>addressbook.rb</b>.
Now, create a new file (in the same directory) and type:</p>

                   <!-- Pick a small width so the table has to
                        expand and just fits the required size. -->
                   <table class="code" width="10%">
                   <tr>
                   <td>
                   <pre class="code">

require "addressbook"

#  Sandy

addr = Address.new
addr.street = "324 Campus Dr."  
addr.city   = "College Park"
addr.state  = "MD"
addr.zip    = "23659"

puts addr
                       </pre>

                       </td>
                       </tr>
                       </table>

<p>Run the program, and you should get:</p>

                   <!-- Pick a small width so the table has to
                        expand and just fits the required size. -->
                   <table class="code" width="10%">
                   <tr>
                   <td>
                   <pre class="shell">

$ ruby prog.rb 
    324 Campus Dr.  
    College Park
    MD, 23659
$
                       </pre>

                       </td>
                       </tr>
                       </table>

<p>The <b>require</b> line lets you reuse your code on any other programs
you write.</p>
