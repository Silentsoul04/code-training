<h1>Why Tk?</h1>

<p>There are many graphical toolkits around.  Why did I pick
Tk for this introductory tutorial?</p>

<h2>Short answer:</h2>
<p>Because Tk is free, easy to use, runs in nearly all platforms and 
comes automatically with Ruby.</p>

<h2>Long answer:</h2>

<p>There are several toolkits around.  Many of them are much more powerful
than Tk?  Why did I pick Tk?.  Well, here are my reasons:

<ul>
  <li><p>Tk comes with Ruby automatically.  I don't have to take a detour 
      to show you how to install ruby packages.  This is an important
      reason for me.</p></li>
  <li><p>Tk runs on almost every platform.  When you write a program with
      Ruby/Tk, you can be confident that it'll run on everywhere.</p></li>
  <li><p>Tk is one of the easier toolkits to learn and use.  This is
      important for an introductory tutorial.</p></li>
  <li><p>Tk is both free and open source.  With Tk, you are not dependent
      on a software provider who might suddenly decide to stop supporting
      the product or raise their prices.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There are a few more toolkits that I feel I should mention:</p>


<ul>
  <li><p>
   <a href="http://www.imasy.or.jp/~hisa/mac/rubycocoa/index.en.html">
    Ruby Cocoa</a>: Bindings for the MacOS X Cocoa.  It's probably
    a good choice if you want to develop for the Mac.</p></li>

  <li><p><a href="http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.net/">Ruby-GNOME2</a>:
    Bindings for Gtk+2 and Gnome2.  This is my personal favorite.
    This toolkit is very powerful and easy to use.  This is a good
    choice if you want to develop for Linux or Unix.</p>

    <p>Gtk+'s support for other platforms is improving.  I hope that
    one day I can recommend Gtk+ as a multi-platform toolkit.</p>

  <li><p><a href="http://fxruby.sourceforge.net">FXRuby</a>:
    Bindings for Fox.  Like Tk, this is a cross-platform library.
    Like Tk, it doesn't look native.  The Windows version of Ruby comes
    with FXRuby and Fox.  If you plan to develop on Windows, this might
    be a good choice.  A lot of people in the Ruby community like it.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
