    <h1>Where to get help</h1>

<!-- Mention: ri, irb and the ruby debugger at some point. -->

<p>There are several sources of help for Ruby.  I have categorized them as:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#tech">Tech Support </a></li>
<li><a href="#docs">Documentation</a></li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2><a name="tech">Tech support</a></h2>

<p>As far as I know, there is no 1-800-RUBY support line.  But Ruby comes 
with community-based support which is <em>better</em> than any support 
money can buy.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Mailing list</strong></dt>
  <dd>
  <p>The Ruby mailing list is probably the best way to get help on Ruby.
  The people of this list are quick to respond, helpful and very friendly.
  To subscribe send an email to <em><a href="ruby-talk-ctl@ruby-lang.org">
  ruby-talk-ctl@ruby-lang.org</a></em> with the following in the body of
  the message (not the subject):</p>

  <p><tt>subscribe Your-First-Name Your-Last-Name</tt></p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> this is a high-traffic mailing list.
  You will get a lot of emails a day.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><strong>IRC</strong></dt>
  <dd>
  <p>If you have an IRC client (and there are several free ones) you
  can get real-time support through Ruby's IRC channel.  Just connect to
  <em>irc.freenode.net</em> and join <tt>#ruby-lang</tt></p>
  </dd>

  <dt><strong>Ruby User Groups</strong></dt>
  <dd>
  <p>If there is a Ruby User Group near where you live, this is a great way
  to get Ruby help and socialize at the same time.  You can find a listing
  of Ruby User Groups at:</p>

  <p>
    <a href="http://www.rubygarden.org/ruby?RubyUserGroups">
	  http://www.rubygarden.org/ruby?RubyUserGroups
    </a>

<h2><a name="docs">Documentation</a></h2>

<p>In addition to this tutorial, there are other sources of documentation:</p>

<h3>Tutorials</h3>

<p>There is another introductory Ruby tutorial: 
<a href="http://hellotree.gotdns.com/LearnToProgram/">
<strong>Learn to Program</strong></a>, by Chris Pine.  It takes a different approach
at covering much the same material as this book.  I suggest you take a look
at it.</p>

<h3>Books</h3>

<p>There are a few English books on Ruby.  Notice, I have not read the first
two books.  My comments are based on what I've heard from the community.</p>

<dl>

  <dt><strong>Sams Teach Yourself Ruby in 21 Days</strong>
  <dd>
  <p><strong>Author:</strong> Mark Slagell</p>
  <p><strong>Style:</strong> Tutorial</p>
  <p>This is probably the most accessible of the books here.  It does not
  assume any previous knowledge by the user.  It takes a tutorial style to
  teaching Ruby.  It starts with the most basic and covers quite a bit of
  ground before it's finished.  It has received great reviews by the community.
  This is probably a great first book.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><strong>The Ruby Way</strong></dt>
  <dd>
  <p><strong>Author:</strong> Hal Fulton</p>
  <p><strong>Style:</strong> Cookbook</p>
  <p>This book takes a cookbook-style approach to Ruby.  You will find
  Ruby-based solutions for a large number of problems.  This is a medium
  difficulty book and it has been highly recommended by the community.</p>
  <p>I am personally very fond of the cookbook style of books.  This is
  probably the first book that <em>I</em> would buy.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><strong>Programming Ruby (PickAxe)</strong></dt>
  <dd>
  <p><strong>Author:</strong> David Thomas</p>
  <p><strong>Style:</strong> Reference</p>
  <p>This book is a very complete reference on Ruby.  It is fondly
  referred to as "PickAxe" because the book cover depics a pickaxe.
  This is, by far, the most often mentioned book in the Ruby mailing list.
  It is an excellent reference.</p>
  <p>This book is a fair bit more advanced than this tutorial.  It assumes 
  that the reader already has a programming background and understands
  object orientation.  This book is available online at:</p>
